Install steps	
	1. Make sure you already have the libraries (On Debian based systems, you need the libsdl2-*-dev packages)
	2. Copy the desired vapi files in the 3rd party vapi directory: /usr/local/share/vala/vapi/
You can optionally run the install script (sh INSTALL) to do the copy for you
You can optionally export VAPI_PATH to customize the path where the vapis will
be instaled.
To build your application use this command (Remove packages if unneeded):

valac -o appname --pkg sdl2 --pkg sdl2-gfx --pkg sdl2-ttf --pkg sdl2-image --pkg sdl2-mixer -X -lSDL2_image  -X -lSDL2_ttf -X -lSDL2_mixer -X -lSDL2_gfx appname.vala
